    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python code which may include functions, classes, and variables, as well as runnable code. These modules are used to organize code in a logical way, allowing code to be reused between different programs. Modules can also help you manage and segment your program into parts that are easier to understand and use."

    "#### How to Import Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import a Whole Module**: You can import the whole module by using the `import` statement. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Specific Attributes**: You can import specific functions, classes, or attributes from a module using the `from` keyword:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import sqrt\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Import with Aliases**: If you want to shorten module names or function names, Python allows you to import modules or functionalities using an alias:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math as m\n",
    "   print(m.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "   from math import sqrt as s\n",
    "   print(s(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import All Attributes**: You can import all attributes and functions of a module using `*`. This is generally discouraged because it can lead to conflicts with local variable names and is not very clear for someone reading the code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import *\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```"

    "### Creating Custom Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own modules by writing Python code in a `.py` file and importing it using the same syntax. Suppose you have a file called `mymodule.py` containing the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import and use this in another Python script as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mymodule\n",
    "mymodule.greet(\"Ryan\")  # Outputs: Hello, Ryan!\n",
    "```"

    "### Module Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, Python searches in a predefined set of locations:\n",
    "1. The directory of the script you are running.\n",
    "2. The directories in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (if set).\n",
    "3. The standard library directories.\n",
    "4. The site-packages directory (for installed packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python cannot find the module in any of these locations, it will raise an `ImportError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modules is a fundamental part of Python programming, enabling code reuse, organizational clarity, and functionality extension. Understanding how to properly create and import modules can greatly enhance your productivity and the readability of your code."
