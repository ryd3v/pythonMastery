    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python code which may include functions, classes, and variables, as well as runnable code. These modules are used to organize code in a logical way, allowing code to be reused between different programs. Modules can also help you manage and segment your program into parts that are easier to understand and use."

    "#### How to Import Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import a Whole Module**: You can import the whole module by using the `import` statement. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Specific Attributes**: You can import specific functions, classes, or attributes from a module using the `from` keyword:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import sqrt\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Import with Aliases**: If you want to shorten module names or function names, Python allows you to import modules or functionalities using an alias:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math as m\n",
    "   print(m.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "   from math import sqrt as s\n",
    "   print(s(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import All Attributes**: You can import all attributes and functions of a module using `*`. This is generally discouraged because it can lead to conflicts with local variable names and is not very clear for someone reading the code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import *\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```"

    "### Creating Custom Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own modules by writing Python code in a `.py` file and importing it using the same syntax. Suppose you have a file called `mymodule.py` containing the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import and use this in another Python script as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mymodule\n",
    "mymodule.greet(\"Ryan\")  # Outputs: Hello, Ryan!\n",
    "```"

    "### Module Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, Python searches in a predefined set of locations:\n",
    "1. The directory of the script you are running.\n",
    "2. The directories in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (if set).\n",
    "3. The standard library directories.\n",
    "4. The site-packages directory (for installed packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python cannot find the module in any of these locations, it will raise an `ImportError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modules is a fundamental part of Python programming, enabling code reuse, organizational clarity, and functionality extension. Understanding how to properly create and import modules can greatly enhance your productivity and the readability of your code."

    "### Example Standard Module Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    " Python has a robust standard library that offers a wide range of modules which can be used for various purposes without the need for external dependencies. Here are a few standard Python modules along with their primary functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **math** - Provides access to mathematical functions like trigonometric functions, logarithms, and other common mathematical operations.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **datetime** - Allows you to manipulate dates and times, performing operations like date arithmetic, formatting, and parsing.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import datetime\n",
    "   now = datetime.datetime.now()\n",
    "   print(now)  # Outputs current date and time\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **os** - Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to a file system, managing directories, and more.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   print(os.getcwd())  # Outputs the current working directory\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **sys** - Gives you access to variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "   sys.exit()  # Exits the Python program\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **json** - Used for parsing and emitting JSON data. Extremely useful for web and network operations.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import json\n",
    "   json_data = '{\"name\": \"Ryan\", \"age\": 30}'\n",
    "   parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)\n",
    "   print(parsed_data)  # Outputs: {'name': 'Ryan', 'age': 30}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **random** - Provides functions for generating random numbers, picking random items, shuffling lists, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import random\n",
    "   print(random.randint(1, 100))  # Outputs a random integer between 1 and 100\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **subprocess** - Allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import subprocess\n",
    "   subprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\"])  # Runs the 'ls -l' command in Linux\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **requests** (Note: Not part of the standard library, but commonly used for HTTP requests. Included here because it is often mistaken as standard but requires installation.)\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import requests\n",
    "   response = requests.get(\"https://api.github.com\")\n",
    "   print(response.json())  # Outputs JSON response from GitHub's API\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These modules form just a part of the vast standard library Python offers, enabling developers to perform a wide range of programming tasks efficiently."
