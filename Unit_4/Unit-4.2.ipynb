    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python code which may include functions, classes, and variables, as well as runnable code. These modules are used to organize code in a logical way, allowing code to be reused between different programs. Modules can also help you manage and segment your program into parts that are easier to understand and use."

    "#### How to Import Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import a Whole Module**: You can import the whole module by using the `import` statement. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Specific Attributes**: You can import specific functions, classes, or attributes from a module using the `from` keyword:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import sqrt\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Import with Aliases**: If you want to shorten module names or function names, Python allows you to import modules or functionalities using an alias:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math as m\n",
    "   print(m.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "   from math import sqrt as s\n",
    "   print(s(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import All Attributes**: You can import all attributes and functions of a module using `*`. This is generally discouraged because it can lead to conflicts with local variable names and is not very clear for someone reading the code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from math import *\n",
    "   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n",
    "   ```"
