Here's a structured learning plan to master the basics of Python:

### Week 1-2: Python Basics

- **Day 1-3**: Introduction to Python. Setup Python environment, understand Python syntax, and write basic programs.
- **Day 4-7**: Learn about data types (strings, numbers, booleans), operators, and basic input/output.

### Week 3-4: Control Structures and Data Structures

- **Day 1**: Focus on control structures - if statements, for and while loops, break and continue statements.
- **Day 2**: Introduction to basic data structures - lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Practice creating and
  manipulating them.

### Week 5-6: Functions and Error Handling

- **Day 1**: Learn to write functions, understand scope, and pass arguments. Explore built-in functions.
- **Week 6**: Basics of error and exception handling. Understand try-except blocks.

### Week 7-8: File Handling and Modules

- **Week 7**: Introduction to file handling - reading from and writing to files.
- **Week 8**: Learn about Python modules and how to import them. Explore a few standard libraries.

### Week 9-10: Object-Oriented Programming

- **Week 9**: Introduction to classes and objects. Understand the basics of object-oriented programming.
- **Week 10**: Dive deeper into OOP concepts - inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### Week 11-12: Mini Projects and Review

- **Week 11**: Start working on a simple project, like a calculator, a basic game, or a simple data processing tool.
- **Week 12**: Review all the topics. Revisit areas where you feel less confident and refine your project.

### Additional Tips:

- **Daily Coding**: Aim for at least 1 hour of coding each day.
- **Practice Problems**: Regularly solve practice problems on platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codecademy.
- **Seek Feedback**: Share your code with peers or mentors and seek feedback.
- **Documentation**: Make a habit of reading Python documentation.
- **Stay Curious**: If you find a topic interesting, feel free to explore it further beyond the basics.

Remember, consistency is key. Adjust the pace according to your learning speed and comfort. The goal is to build a solid
foundation, not to rush through the topics.
