    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several key concepts, which we'll briefly discuss here..\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Instances (Objects)**:\n",
    "Classes can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and can have attributes and behaviors defined by their classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Dog:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "            self.name = name  # Attribute of the Dog class\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def bark(self):  # Method of the Dog class\n",
    "            return f\"{self.name} is barking!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_dog = Dog(\"Fido\")  # Creating an instance of the Dog class\n",
    "    print(my_dog.bark())  # Outputs: Fido is barking!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). This also leads to data hiding which is protecting an object's internal state from outside modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "            self._color = color  # The underscore suggests this is a protected member\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def drive(self):\n",
    "            # Method to drive the car\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, enabling code reusability and the creation of hierarchical class structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Vehicle:\n",
    "        # This is the base/parent class.\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Truck(Vehicle):\n",
    "        # This is the derived/child class inheriting from Vehicle.\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "Polymorphism refers to the way in which different object classes can share the same method name, but those methods can act differently based on which object calls them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Cat:\n",
    "        def speak(self):\n",
    "            return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Duck:\n",
    "        def speak(self):\n",
    "            return \"Quack!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "        print(animal.speak())\n",
    "    \n",
    "    animal_sound(Cat())  # Outputs: Meow!\n",
    "    animal_sound(Duck())  # Outputs: Quack!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "Abstraction means dealing with the level of complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. This can be achieved by using abstract classes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Shape(ABC):  # Abstract Base Class\n",
    "        @abstractmethod\n",
    "        def area(self):\n",
    "            pass  # Abstract Method\n",
    "    \n",
    "        @abstractmethod\n",
    "        def perimeter(self):\n",
    "            pass  # Abstract Method\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "            self.width = width\n",
    "            self.height = height\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def area(self):\n",
    "            return self.width * self.height\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def perimeter(self):\n",
    "            return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "    ```"
