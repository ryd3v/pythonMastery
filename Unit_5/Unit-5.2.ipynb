    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in Python is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) by which one class (known as a child or derived class) can derive properties and behaviors `methods` from another class (known as a parent or base class). This allows for a hierarchy of classes, where you can abstract out common functionalities and attributes into a base class and create specialized versions in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of the key aspects of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Class**: This is the class from which other classes inherit properties and methods. It is also referred to as the `parent`, `superclass`, or `ancestor` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derived Class**: This class inherits from the base class and is also known as the `child`, `subclass`, or `descendant` class. It can override or extend the functionalities of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance Types**:\n",
    "   - *Single Inheritance*: A derived class inherits from one base class.\n",
    "   - *Multiple Inheritance*: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
    "   - *Multilevel Inheritance*: A derived class inherits from a base class, which itself is a derived class of another base class.\n",
    "   - *Hierarchical Inheritance*: Multiple derived classes inherit from one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The `super()` Function**: This function allows you to call the parent class's method in the derived class, which is especially useful when you want to extend the functionality of the inherited method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example that illustrates basic inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:  # Base class\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclasses must implement this method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Derived class\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):  # Another derived class\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the classes\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "print(my_dog.speak())  # Outputs: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "my_cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "print(my_cat.speak())  # Outputs: Whiskers says Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Animal` is the base class with a method `speak()` that's intended to be overridden.\n",
    "- `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes that inherit from `Animal` and provide their own implementation of the `speak()` method."

    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming `OOP`, including in Python. It describes the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the internal state of an object from the outside. This is done by providing access to the data only through methods and by restricting direct access to the internal data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is achieved using private and protected member variables and functions. While Python does not have explicit access modifiers like `private` or `protected` (as seen in languages like Java or C++), it follows a convention to signify that a member is intended to be private or protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how encapsulation can be implemented in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Members**: In Python, you can prefix an attribute or method name with double underscores (`__`) to make it private—meaning it should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__private_variable = \"I am private\"\n",
    "        self.public_variable = \"I am public\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __private_method(self):\n",
    "        return \"This is a private method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def public_method(self):\n",
    "        return \"This is a public method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "example = Example()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the public variable and method is fine\n",
    "print(example.public_variable)\n",
    "print(example.public_method())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the private variable and method will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "# print(example.__private_variable)  # Uncommenting this line would cause an error\n",
    "# print(example.__private_method())  # Uncommenting this line would cause an error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected Members**: Similarly, you can prefix an attribute or method name with a single underscore (`_`) to indicate that it is intended to be protected. Protected members are meant for internal use within the class and its subclasses, and like private members, are not meant to be accessed from outside the class, although it is more of a convention than a strict rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Base:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._protected_variable = \"I am protected\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def _protected_method(self):\n",
    "        return \"This is a protected method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Derived(Base):\n",
    "    def call_protected_members(self):\n",
    "        # Accessing protected variable and method from within a subclass\n",
    "        print(self._protected_variable)\n",
    "        print(self._protected_method())\n",
    "\n",
    "derived = Derived()\n",
    "derived.call_protected_members()\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's not recommended to do this, but you can still access the protected members from outside\n",
    "print(derived._protected_variable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, encapsulation in Python is not enforced by the language's syntax but by naming conventions and \n",
    "gentleman's agreement. Encapsulation helps in maintaining a clear separation between the interface and implementation of classes, allows for data hiding, and helps programmers work with a more manageable and structured codebase."

    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in the context of programming languages like Python refers to the ability of different types of objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique way. The term \"polymorphism\" comes from the Greek words \"poly,\" meaning many, and \"morph,\" meaning form. Therefore, polymorphism means \"many forms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism is a key principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows for flexibility and the use of a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of polymorphism in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duck Typing**: Python is a dynamically-typed language, which implies that the type of the variable is decided at runtime, and we don't need to specify the type of the variable. This behavior leads to what is known as duck typing, which is a concept where the type or the class of the object is less important than the methods it defines. Using duck typing, we can call any method on any object, as long as the method exists for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Duck:\n",
    "        def quack(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Quack, quack!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def quack(self):\n",
    "            print(\"I'm Quacking like a duck!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def in_the_forest(mallard):\n",
    "        mallard.quack()\n",
    "\n",
    "    donald = Duck()\n",
    "    john = Person()\n",
    "    in_the_forest(donald)  # Outputs: Quack, quack!\n",
    "    in_the_forest(john)    # Outputs: I'm Quacking like a duck!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both Duck and Person have a `.quack()` method and can thus be used interchangeably within the `in_the_forest` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Method Overriding**: In Python, if a subclass provides an implementation of a method that already exists in its superclass, it is known as method overriding. When a particular method is called, the interpreter looks for the method starting from the object's actual class and then moves up its inheritance chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "        def speak(self):\n",
    "            return 'I am an animal'\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "        def speak(self):\n",
    "            return 'I am a dog'\n",
    "\n",
    "    animal = Animal()\n",
    "    dog = Dog()\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())  # Outputs: I am an animal\n",
    "    print(dog.speak())     # Outputs: I am a dog\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `speak()` method of `Dog` overrides the `speak()` method of `Animal`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operator Overloading**: Python allows different classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators. This is called operator overloading. For example, by defining the `__add__` method, you can dictate what happens when you use the `+` operator on instances of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Vector:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "            self.x = x\n",
    "            self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "    v1 = Vector(2, 4)\n",
    "    v2 = Vector(3, -2)\n",
    "    result = v1 + v2\n",
    "    print(result.x, result.y)  # Outputs: 5 2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The two instances of `Vector` can be added using the `+` operator because we've overloaded the `__add__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python supports the \"open/closed principle,\" which states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means you can add new functionality without changing the existing code structure, which helps to reduce risks and minimize changes throughout the codebase."

    "#### Abstraction \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in Python, as in many other object-oriented programming languages, is a concept and a process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It's a key principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is used to reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstraction can be implemented using classes and interfaces. Classes contain methods (functions) and attributes (data), and they can use abstraction to hide the detailed workings of these methods from the user. These methods defined in the class are the interface through which a user can interact with the functionalities of the class without knowing what's going on under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss some of the key elements related to abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes and Objects:\n",
    "- **Classes**: They are the blueprints for creating objects (a particular data structure). A class encapsulates data for the object.\n",
    "- **Objects**: They are instances of classes; they instantiate the class’s properties and represent a specific instance of the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Classes and Methods:\n",
    "- **Abstract Classes**: Python contains a module named `abc` (Abstract Base Class) that provides the infrastructure for defining abstract classes. Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "- **Abstract Methods**: An abstract method is a method that is declared, but it contains no implementation. Subclasses that inherit an abstract class must provide an implementation for the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an abstract class and abstract methods in Python, you can use the `abc` module like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class AbstractClassName(ABC):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def abstract_method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def concrete_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a concrete method.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes that inherit from `AbstractClassName` must implement the `abstract_method` or else they will also become abstract classes and you can’t create instances of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use-Case Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a program that processes different types of documents. You don't want to hardcode the processing for each document type. Instead, you create an abstract class called 'DocumentProcessor' with an abstract method 'process'. Each subclass then implements the 'process' method according to the specifics of the document type it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DocumentProcessor(ABC):\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def process(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class PDFProcessor(DocumentProcessor):\n",
    "    def process(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Processing PDF document.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class WordProcessor(DocumentProcessor):\n",
    "    def process(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Processing Word document.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# now you can use them like this\n",
    "my_pdf_processor = PDFProcessor()\n",
    "my_pdf_processor.process()  # prints: Processing PDF document.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `process` is the abstraction layer. When using the `PDFProcessor` or `WordProcessor`, you don't need to know how exactly the processing is implemented. You just know that you can call the `process` method on any `DocumentProcessor` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that abstraction, as a principle, aims to reduce complexity by hiding the intricate details behind simple interfaces. It allows programmers to build upon the abstract foundation without having to understand everything underneath."
